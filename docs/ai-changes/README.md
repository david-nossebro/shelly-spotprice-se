# AI Changes Documentation

This directory contains documentation for all AI-assisted changes made to the Shelly Spotprice SE project. Each AI improvement project gets its own dated folder to maintain a clear history of changes.

## Directory Structure

```

├── README.md                                    # This overview file

    ├── PLAN.md                                 # Planning document for the project
    ├── SUMMARY.md                              # Summary of completed changes
    └── [additional project-specific files]     # Any other relevant documentation
```

## Naming Convention

AI project folders use the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-project-description`

Examples:
- `2025-01-01-ai-compatibility-improvements`
- `2025-02-15-performance-optimization`
- `2025-03-10-error-handling-enhancement`

## Purpose

This structure serves to:

1. **Track AI Contributions**: Maintain a clear record of what changes were made by AI tools vs. human developers
2. **Provide Context**: Each project folder contains planning documents and summaries for future reference
3. **Enable Reproducibility**: Document the reasoning and approach used for each AI-assisted improvement
4. **Facilitate Review**: Make it easy for developers to understand and review AI-generated changes
5. **Maintain History**: Preserve a chronological record of AI-assisted project evolution

## Usage

When starting a new AI-assisted improvement project:

1. Create a new folder using the naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-project-description`
2. Copy the template files from `TEMPLATE/` to your new project folder
3. Fill out the `PLAN.md` with your improvement goals and approach
4. Document your progress and results in `SUMMARY.md` as you work
5. Include any additional project-specific documentation as needed
