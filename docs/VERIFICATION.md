## Verification Commands

Run these commands to verify the improvements:

```bash
# Verify linting
npm run lint

# Run all tests
npm test

# Check TypeScript definitions
npx tsc --noEmit --project jsconfig.json

# Verify build process
npm run build

# Check documentation links (if link checker is available)
# markdown-link-check docs/*.md
```
